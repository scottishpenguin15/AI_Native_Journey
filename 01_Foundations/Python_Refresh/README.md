# QuizMe! â€“ Personalized Python Quiz Game

## About This Project
QuizMe! is an interactive, beginner-friendly Python mini-project designed to help non-technical users learn programming fundamentals and AI prompting. The game guides users through a personalized experience, letting them choose a learning path and participate in a fun Mad Libs activity, all while demonstrating clear logic, user input validation, and friendly feedback.

## How It Works
- **Personalized Welcome:** The program prompts users for their name and lets them select a learning path from a list (e.g., Machine Learning Basics, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision).
- **User Input & Validation:** It ensures users enter valid information, providing helpful prompts and error messages if needed.
- **Mad Libs Activity:** Users are asked to enter a noun, verb, and adjective, which are then used to create a playful, AI-generated story.
- **Core Logic:** The project uses Python lists and dictionaries to organize learning paths and user data. All prompts, feedback, and story generation are handled through simple, readable functions, making the code easy to follow and expand.

## How to Run It
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `01_Foundations/Python_Refresh` directory.
3. Run the program with:
   ```
   python3 welcome.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your name, choose a learning path, and participate in the Mad Libs game!
